# Zabasandbox
This is a sandbox for sharing random ideas code snippets or trials

There are no rules here other than this:

* respect noobs
* don't judge errors, just help to correct them
* have fun and enjoy learning to code

### This repo will be periodically updated, either on a project by project basis or by deleting old projects on an ad-hoc basis.

#### The following is a list of projects and a short description of each that will act as a timeline for this repo:
1. material-app
* this is a walkthrough of a material tutorial found on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnKsoCeTdEI&t=22s
2. bug-attempt
* this is an attempt at fixing a bug addressed by readers of my medium article on ngx-translate that can be found here https://medium.com/letsboot/translate-angular-4-apps-with-ngx-translate-83302fb6c10d
* The initial code posted worked but used

   import { HttpModule, Http } from '@angular/http';
* this was then replaced by:

   import { HttpClientModule, HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
